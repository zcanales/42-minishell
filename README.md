- Wildcards * in the current working directory
- ```‚Äô``` (single quotes: inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters)
- ```"``` (double quotes: inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters except for $.)
- ```$?``` expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- ```|```  Pipes: The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe to the input of the next command.
